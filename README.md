# learning-ai
A place to store files on the different steps that I have taken to learn AI with Python.

## Steps completed so far:
01. Make a basic API call to ChatGPT
02. Teach ChatGPT about a basic math function and use it
03. Teach ChatGPT about a basic math function via Pydantic and use it

## Current step being worked on:
04. Use LangChain to get user input for a location and have ChatGPT look up the weather via an external API
